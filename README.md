# Color-sonifier
This program was developed to aid in my study in chemical laboratory at Chulalongkorn University.

It receives a camera feed from the raspberry pie camera and converts a color of a group of pixels at the center of the frame to sound.
The pitch of the sound corresponds to the hue axis in the HSV color scheme.
The volume of the sound corresponds to the value axis in the HSV color scheme.
